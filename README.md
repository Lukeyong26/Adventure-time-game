# Adventure Time Dungeon Game

## About
This Dungeon game was a university project done in 2019 by myself and 2 other brilliant team members. It was done in eclipse but I have since adapted it to run using VSCode still compiled using Maven. It was writen in Java using the JavaFX library. 

The game uses mainly sprites from the cartoon adventure time thus the name. 

## How to run
Open with VS Code and run file: DungeonGame.java
